stage-lighting
==============

Here at [ARHS](http://arhs.arps.org/) we do quite a bit of stage lighting,
from huge productions like the annual musical to powerpoint presentations.
This repo will serve as the hub for collective tech knowledge.

## Lighting System
##### DMX Instruments
Scrollers and mirrors are connected to our lighting control via DMX. They self
assign a dimmer address, (usually) above 200, and can be patched like a
regular light, but instead of their level controlling intensity, it sets a
a scroll position in the scrollers, and a pan or tilt for the mirror.

## Lighting Design
### LX[Beams|Free]
#### Patch
LX can be used to record the patch of the lighting plot, through the Chanel and Dimmer fields on any instrument.
#### Exporting
A patch can be exported from the LX software into the ETC Express, through a
rather convulated process

##### DMX Instruments
*Refer to [DMX Instruments](#dmx-instruments) for a background.*
